Tensor-calculator
=================

Here is a programme that can calculate the basic tensors in general relativity wirtten by Mathematica.

I used to calculate the tensors in Walker-Robertson metric in one sunny afternoon. It spent me 3 hours, but failed.
So, I made up my mind to do this.

It's not over. But, since I still do not famillar with Mathematica, I take a lot of time to make it better.

What a pity! If you want to download it, the usual way ("Save Link As") is impossible. There is something wrong with it.
So, one way to download is to copy the code into a text editor and saveas "XXX.nb". And then run it in <i>Mathematica</i>.
