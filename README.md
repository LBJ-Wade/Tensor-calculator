Tensor-calculator
=================

Here is a programme that can calculate the basic tensors in general relativity wirtten by <i>Mathematica</i>.

(This works well on <i>Mathematica</i> 8.0.)

I used to calculate the tensors in Walker-Robertson metric in one sunny afternoon. It spent me 3 hours, but failed.
So, I made up my mind to do this.

It's not over. But, since I still do not famillar with <i>Mathematica</i>, I take a lot of time to make it better.

It can calculate, analytically:

* Basic tensors used in G.R., thus other tensors based on them;
* Perturbations of tensors;
* Co-variant derivative;
* Simple contraction;
* And so on. To be continued!

<i>For installation and usage as well as other details on this programme, see the documentation within the "TensorCalculator" directory, especially those examples.</i>

<fontcolor="red">But the function 'contract[tensorA, tensorB] cannot be used for composition, which, however, is basic property for any function.</font>
