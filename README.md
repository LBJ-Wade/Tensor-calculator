Tensor-calculator
=================

Here is a programme that can calculate the basic tensors in general relativity wirtten by Mathematica.

I used to calculate the tensors in Walker-Robertson metric in one sunny afternoon. It spent me 3 hours, but failed.
So, I made up my mind to do this.

It's not over. But, since I still do not famillar with Mathematica, I takes a lot of time to make it better.
